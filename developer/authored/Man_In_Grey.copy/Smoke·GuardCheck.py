Smoke·GuardCheck - the guard's checks of the Smoke instruction language, the tester's smoke test.

It exists to exercise the gate, the guard library and the interpreter
library, and is not for use on a system: its constraints can say where a
file goes, and with what mode, owner and permission, but not what the file
says, and a configuration file's content is what its reader does. It is a
constrained form of the POSIX file interface. The instructions and their
types are in Smoke·Language.py.

The modes of open:

  create         the file must not exist
  replace        an existing file is discarded
  replace-keep   an existing file is kept as <name>.YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ

There is no close. Each opened file is written to a temporary file in its
directory, and after the journal's last instruction every opened file is
put in place, each in one step.

This module holds the guard's checks of the language, made after the
well-formed guard has checked the journal against the definition. They are
LIST__CHECK:

  language     the values of the literals: absolute directories in normal
               form, bare file names, a known mode, an account name, a
               permission from 0 to 0o7777
  constraint   the predicates at the top of the guard, Smoke·Guard.py:
               is__allowed_account, is__allowed_open and is__allowed_unlink
  validity     every owner is an account
  filesystem   each directory, reached through no symbolic link, and each
               file, named by one instruction only, regular or absent

A file variable can only hold what an open wrote there, since a handle is
never a literal; so the well-formed guard has already ensured every write
writes a file some open opened.

The implementation of the instructions is in Smoke·LibraryInstruction.py.
