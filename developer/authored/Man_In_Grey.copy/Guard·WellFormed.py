"""
Guard·WellFormed - the well-formed guard: a journal checked against its language definition.

A journal is straight-line: no branch, no loop. So one pass from first
instruction to last settles, for every argument, whether it is well formed:
every variable is declared, its type is the type the format names, it is
written before it is read, and the result is written by the end. Scan makes
that pass. The guard and the interpreter make it on the journal they
receive, through is__well_formed_journal; the journal interface makes it as
each instruction is placed, so a composer's mistake is an error when the
composer makes it.

The pass also resolves each instruction for the language's own checks, as
InstructionView: the values of its literals, and for each variable the
instruction that last wrote it.

This module is a library.
