journal_interpreter - the general journal interpreter of Man_In_Grey.

A bespoke journal interpreter is a gate, a guard and this general
interpreter. The bespoke interpreter chooses the command language and the
constraints, and calls interpret(). interpret() decodes the journal, runs the
language's checks in order, the guard among them, and executes the journal
only when every check finds nothing wrong. A check that finds problems lists
them all, and the journal is refused whole.

This module is a library; it is not run by itself.
