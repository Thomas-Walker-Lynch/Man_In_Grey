"""
interpreter_emplace_bio - the interpreter of the emplace_bio instruction language.

Started by the gate Man_In_Grey_emplace_bio_gate, with the gate's real and
effective ids, and with the journal on standard input, once the guard has
passed the journal. It executes the journal's instructions, and writes to
standard error, as <tag>: <message>, a line for each lasting change it
makes, such as a file put in place, and none for an instruction as such.
The gate logs the journal's course itself.

When it has played the whole journal, it writes one line to standard output,

  interpreter emplace_bio journal played

and exits 0. The gate takes the journal as played on that line and that
status together, and on nothing else.

It checks again that the journal is well formed before executing it. It
does not check the constraints; that is the guard's work, and the gate
starts the interpreter only on the guard's verdict. It imports the guard,
guard_emplace_bio.py, for what execution needs from the constraints at its top.

Before it imports anything, it checks that its modules and their directory
are owned by root or by the effective uid's account, and writable by no
other account.

Usage: interpreter_emplace_bio <command>
  help | -h   print this message (also printed when given no arguments)
  execute     execute the journal on standard input

Exit status: 0 when the journal was executed, 1 when execution failed,
2 when the journal could not be read or is not well formed.
